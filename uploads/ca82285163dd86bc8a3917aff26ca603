Tuf:
Hello?
Eve:
Hi, good. Hi. How are you?
Tuf:
Okay.
Eve:
Yeah, I'm good. I'm freezing. We've literally not got any heating on just because it's so expensive. I work from home. Do you?

Tuf:
Yeah.
Eve:
Nice. Nice. Where’s home?
Tuf:
Isle of Dogs, London. Right near Canary Warf.
Eve:
Hi. Wait. So you on an island?

Tuf:
Yes, it's almost like an island.
Eve:
Do you get a boat?
Tuf:
No, no, no, no, it's not separate from London. Just goes out into the river. 
Eve:
Okay. Nice. That sounds loud. Well, expensive. My God.
Tuf:
Right. Where are you from?
Eve:
So, I live near Reading 
Tuf:
The place, but…
Eve:
Yeah, yeah. I'm like an hour and a half out from London. Our offices are in a really funky place to go to. Somewhere out West, near Shepherd’s Bush, you get the overground… like where there’s like a lot of  a decent clubs.
Tuf:
In London? Shepherd’s Bush?

Eve:
Yeah. No, 'm gonna have to figure it out. Anyway, we’re remote first.
Tuf:
I'm just going to shut that window. Yeah, one sec.
Eve:
Yeah. Go for it.
Tuf:
Yeah, sorry.
Eve:
No worries. Sorry, I noticed I reached out to you a couple of weeks ago, firstly, hopefully everything's right? I know you sent me yesterday about some personal stuff. I hate everything's okay. I know how well that's life. It can just get quite a lot so.
Tuf:
Yeah.
Eve:
Hopefully everything's okay. Your end?
Tuf:
Hey, sorry. Yeah, you've been trying to, we've been trying to get onto this call for 3 weeks no.
Eve:
If I, hey, no worries. It's kind of, yeah.
Tuf:
I almost postponed today as over for, you know?
Eve:
Yeah. Let's just do it.
Tuf:
I have two interviews that I'm doing today in between this meeting as well.
Call Setup ends
Eve:
Okay. Well, that, that's the spend 45 minutes then?
Tuf:
OK
Eve:
I know from reached out to you. So it was kind of probably wasn’t a time where you everyou considering Pento, but it looks like you’re the person who runs payroll, is that right? Because I've done a bit of research on Genflow that's like you are growing incredible amount. And it tends to be a little bit painful when that's happening.
Tuf:
Yes, because this constantly leavers and starters et cetera.
Eve:
Okay.
Tuf:
So, we outsource our payroll… to Payroll Options.
Eve:
Okay. Good to know.
Tuf:
For…
Eve:
It’s a traditional bureau, right?
Tuf:
Yeah. And I just send the changes to them and then they give me the reporting and the changes are from Hibob (HR system), as you know, which I believe you can integrate with. I can pull out the information from Hibob through an excel sheet… of any changes in that month. And then I forward that excel sheet over to payroll options and then they will send me the report, the summary basically. And I'll just scroll through the summary just to see if that calculation matches up with what I believe is to be a true, based on the payroll I’ve done in the past.
Tuf:
Okay? So I just do my own calculation based on 260 days. If it's a good month, just check if they calculations. So I'll just go through that process after they send the report, the summary. I just make sure the numbers tally up. Once the numbers tally up. I'm gonna keep them the green light, and then they make the backs payment to the employees.
Eve:
Okay. That must be a reason why you started checking them yourselves? Has there been like…
Tuf:
Tthere's not a reason. I just, they… I just have to make sure everything's correct. So.
Eve:
Like at the end of the day it’s pay, as well, right? So, yeah, you want it to be right? How is that relationship? Has everbeen any mistakes? Like we hit particularly when I was like a lot of growth that varies a lot of mistakes from the, our sources. Is that everhappened?
Tuf:
So, I have not, I've not really had an issue with them in terms of mistakes and stuff like that. If anything, they are more supportive then nuisance, as I see it. Just what I find is the process is very long for me. What happens is, our pay date is on the last Friday of the month.
Eve:
Yeah. So.
Tuf:
If I just pull up the calendar actually, this man, so our pay date, this month would be the thirtieth of September.
Eve:
Yeah.
Tuf:
I prepare payroll on the Tuesday before that week. So I prepare it on the twentieth only because they take a couple of days to give me. So I prepare on the twentieth, send it at the latest, on that Wednesday on the 21st and then they take a couple of days. I expect it back on the Friday. The reason why I do that is because I then make the checks. I always say I need like obviously see if there's any check if it's incorrect or if I have any updates on changes, I have another day before the Wednesday. The 28 is when the we close it out and the payments go out to the individuals on the 30th September.
Eve:
I guess with the BACS that takes three to  five working days. So you need time for that before 30th. 
Tuf:
BACS Takes two two days. So if they initiate it and on the thirtieth that he would get paid if you're looking at the calendar this now. So my point, the reason wise, I find it a bit, maybe just too much more than it needs to be is because on the twentieth and 21st I’m dealing with the payroll changes internally because I'm looking at Hibob if we have any new starters. But then if a new starter haven't filled out their form properly and they do upload in the month but I'm not gonna go check every time it gets uploaded. Yeah, I don’t have the capacity on the seventh, eighth and ninth of September to call and see if they've uploaded it correctly. So what I'll do is I look at it fresh on the twentieth of September and I probably have to go back to employees and say, “you didn’t do this properly” or go to HR and be like “this doesn't match with Hibob”. So those two days I literally only two days I literally liaison internally and trying to make sure all the information is correct internally. And then… on the 21st, I usually just send out the changes to the payroll company. So that's two days. I know Friday I receive it. So either on Friday or Monday that will check everything. And if there's any further changes that I have I’ll send them the changes. If not, then I'll just do the checks and then I'm just yup, all good. And then on Wednesday, it gets initiated, I don’t have to do anything. Our BACS limit is 250 K.
Eve:
Wow.
Tuf:
So.
Eve:
Is that an issue now?
Tuf:
That's become an issue now because we’re exceeding the 250 K. So in the last few months, we’ve had  to take a few employees and pay them in cash instead.

Eve:
Wow. Okay. We can talk about how we can resolve that. But yeah, we hear that. We hear that all the time, we’re working with a  company Actually that has gotten the bench out, or whereverit's called, on the funds because their payroll so large now that then they can't run it through one BACS cycle. Okay? That's interesting. We can talk little bit about that.
Tuf:
Okay. So what happens is, alright, so on Monday, so they want me to tell them - this is what I don't like about Payroll Options, they should know our limit is 250k day - I need to tell them every single time. They tell me I have to tell them every time. So every time you exceed it, if we want to exceed it, I need to tell them we exceeded what’s in our BACS amount and go ‘Can you take XYZ out of the BACS And I'll pay them individually?’ So the only mistake they once did was in July I think. he exceeded the BACS amount. I was off for two days. They initiate the BACS. whic then failed and the employees didn’t get paid on time.

Eve:
Really?
Tuf:
Because the BACS didn’t hit, okay. So that was the only accident. Okay. So just refreshing my memory, that was the one with.
Eve:
Yeah. Okay.
Tuf:
So obviously so following that I asked ‘when we exceed, you guys need to let me know. So I can then tell you which employees to take out.’ But they said in fact when they send the report I should let them know which was a bit annoying. So now when I get the reporting but it exceeds our BACS amount, then I select a few that I think obviously will put us back within that 250 limit. And then… I pay them individuals' manually on Wednesday, say opportunity to go out on Friday.
Eve:
Okay. But that makes sense. Yeah, that we've heard that we've had that all the time you wouldn't even believe as well with like companies that start hitting 150-200. They also have to load up the payments themselves manually as well. And I know that that's not the case here, but we know the payments is a big pain for all of our customers. So, yeah, I’ve heard that a couple of times, okay definitely not ideal. You know, I do thank you for giving me the rundown on that. How would you say a month? How much would you say, would you be spending time on payroll right now? I guess that would be a HR person involved as well. Okay?
Tuf:
Hey, if it's just me, it'll probably be, I would say two full days. I wouldn’t say two full working days because I'm doing other things. I would say on that Tuesday slash Wednesday. I'll spend about two to three hours doing the changes. And then… spend probably another half an hour, one hour just going through the report, correct it, going back to liaising with that payroll options, saying about the BACS and stuff has any changes. If there's any discrepancies then obviously, it will take more time. But just going through the report they send is probably another half an hour.
Eve:
Okay. And what the reports like, are they really company convoluted and hard to track? Or if you have a system in your back end, it's kinda made it the easier?
Tuf:
I guess, yeah, I guess the report they sent I'm used to just looking at that now. So I'll just use this. They obviously have the gross wages. I just use the summaries in the departments based on how I want to see it.
Eve:
Some you group people into certain departments to know how much they're getting paid per department?
Tuf:
Yeah. So there's a summary per department
Eve:
Interesting.
Tuf:
It shows the individuals, it shows the individuals and then a summary of that department.
Eve:
Okay. Alright. Yeah, we can definitely talk about reporting and how that streamlined and how that's customizable.
Tuf:
Because then when I'm doing when I'm doing the payroll journal and I need to recognize the cost per department that summary is very important.
Eve:
Yeah, completely agree. And how are you currently manipulating the gross and net pushing it into your accounting software? How is that currently happening?
Tuf:
Yes, I'm just literally create a journal and just pull in the figures based on the report I sent.
Eve:
It doesn't take too long?
Tuf:
I'd say about because the departments side as long, I'd probably say about 10, 15 minutes to do that sound.
Eve:
Okay. Well, that's great because we had 10 15 hours, for those kinds of tasks before. Yeah, but we're talking my thoughts between 500 and about 5,000 employees.
Tuf:
Yeah, it's…
Eve:
Just not, it's just not great. The reason why I asked you. So, talk me though - obviously you are using Hibob, how long have you been using Hibob? How long have you been a Hibob customer for?
Tuf:
Only very recent, I think two months now.
Eve:
Okay, amazing. So, you would have done the implementation, you, would you have some information in that too? Okay, amazing. In terms of what the other HR and finance text stack, what accounting software?
Tuf:
What accounting software, we use Xero
Eve:
Amazing. Okay. We also have integrations there as well.
Tuf:
You guys are pento, right?
Eve:
Yeah.
Tuf:
It's crazy because before I joined Genflow, I had an interview for Pento?
Eve:
Did you actually?
Tuf:
For payroll manager or something? Yeah.
Eve:
Okay. When was that?
Tuf:
That was in October, November, 2020?
Eve:
Wow. That was even before I joined, I joined like a year and a half and I'm like one of the longest I've been in themselves like in the sales/payroll consultancy, but yeah, that would have been way before my time that's crazy.
Tuf:
Okay.
Eve:
Yeah, that's interesting. Did you speak to the CEO?
Tuf:
I think so. It was a lady I spoke to.
Tuf:
I don't remember.
Eve:
[Couldn’t hear this part]
Tuf:
And I've actually know someone that worked at Pento as well
Eve:
Do you?
Tuf:
Catherine…
Eve:
Hello?
Tuf:
Catherine Ponoduie…
Eve:
My God, I'm so interested
Tuf:
Cat with a C
Eve:
I’ll have a look at Slack

Eve:
That’s must have been ages ago
Tuf:
Yeah. So, she was working with before I had the interview there, yeah.
Eve:
That must have been, has it been like even before Danielle and… done now? And then he was that's interesting. Yeah, I've been here for about a year and a half and that must have been before my time. I mean, yeah, a lot has changed since then. That’s super exicting. 


Tuf:
To be honest, I only rejected Pento’s offer once to Genflow came knocking.
Eve:
Really?
Tuf:
Okay.
Eve:
Okay. Well, that's amazing. Okay. So, yeah.  I was looking into you guys at Genflow do. So you're using Xero, it means that there was an integration that, which actually you're in the sweet spot of end-to-end integratoin. So what that means for you guys is, any changes made within Hibob from an employee perspective - any details, name changes, any new staff is added and leavers and  salary changes are populated in Pento in real time. So you won't have to gather any of that data and go back and forth with an outsourcer, so, which is found and not really annoying. Like it's just like taking time out of your day which shouldn't be okay. And then once you submit the payroll that a jorunal will then get pushed into their Xero. When it's completely, it's all automated. So the journal already reconciled against, you know, departments and organizational codes ready for you. So, yeah. So definitely in this sweet spot for end-to-end integration which is amazing. But do, so I was going to show you a bit about Pento. I guess, what do you want to see? I guess that would be, would you be interested to learn a little bit about the HR ingegration first and see what Pento actually looks like?
Tuf:
It would be good to see what Pento looks like. But I would say, if you asked me what I want from Pento, is kind of what you're explaining. I guess is that they take off the information on Hibob, populate it into Xero, make the payments. And I guess the only thing either myself or HR - like at the moment HR is dealing with all of this And then I'm having to check everything. And then I'm having to check it again, once to payroll sends the information. And then I just feel like such a long winded process. I feel like it should be done via a platform. Pento is perfect because I kinda know about Pento.
Eve:
Yeah.
Tuf:
Pento is very streamlined process. And if Pento can take that process where they take off from Hibob and generate into Xero, and make the payments. And if it doesn’t require both me and the HR to constantly do these multiple checks. If now either myself or HR can do that one check.
Eve:
Exactly.
Tuf:
Of all the changes, correct? And that would be the only kind of review process before payments is initiated. That would be perfect.
Eve:
That’s all correct. Which means you remember a lot, sorry, we'll go through that really quick. Which is your pension provider as well? We do have integrations, attention to…
Tuf:
I should know our pension provider.
Tuf:
One second.
Tuf:
Is it in this?
Eve:
If NEST, even better.
Tuf:
Yes. NEST.
Eve:
Amazing. Okay. So we also integrate with NEST as well.
Tuf:
Okay.
Eve:
Well.
Tuf:
That will be great because at the moment, like I'll be damned, I also contact NEST when we have a discrepancy between payments. 
Eve:
Okay. Right? This means that like everything that I was gonna say now is basically changed because obviously you have, you know, a completely connected tech stack and I'll update this slide after the call. I’ll send over an updated version with the right flow of integrations, but essentially, this is what –  So you'd be able to get rid of the outsources and the worries about BACKS and things like payments as we operate faster payments. We can spend a little bit more about what that means to you. But it sounds like this would solve a lot of problems that you're going through right now. But essentially the way Pento is going to sit in the middle and connect to every other tools. And what that means is that Hibob - Any changes that are going to be made within Hibob, So things like, you know, employee information sync, like joiners and leavers, you know, and folks that have started within the month and I know you got, you know, a hell of a lot of growth you’re groing through at the moment. There's probably a lot of pain around that. And then also interesting payslips will be pushed back into Hibob as well. So that integration, it's bidirectional. So that means that your employees will have one source of truth and HiBob will pull that back in. So employees will have all info in one place. 
Tuf:
So the payslips are going into Hibob?
Eve:
Exactly. So let me show you where they would go. So they would go into the shared space within the individual employees section. So it means that, you know, their payslip information is in their HR tool and it means that it's going back into the place they are already really comfortable using.. It enables you to utilize that tool further, you've already spent, you know, a hell of a lot of money on it. So we want to extend that offering one step further as well. So what that means is that you would make any changes. So, I mean, you know, I have overtime or employee variables that you wanna make within Pento, and I'll show you how you do that within Pento. So simple. But honestly, a click of a button. And then what we would do is once you submit payroll, we would then spit out the journal which is already reconciled against your organizational - which is already reconciled against your specific department payments are reconciled. And it’s pushed automatically into Xero.

Tuf:
Yes.
Eve:
What’s also super crucial is the pensions. You mentioned NEST?
Tuf:
Yes, yes. So.
Eve:
With NEST, we also have an integration, so what that means is that Pento is your one source of truth. Any changes have been made by the employees to like any contribution changes or anything like that in Nest is going to get pencilled into Pento in real time as well. So you never have to touch that. So from a reporting perspective, we got you covered. So the payroll report will go out automatically. And also payroll enrollments will happen automatically as well. So you have really in the sweet spot of complete integration if you put Pento within the middle.
Tuf:
I've got a question for goes out in my head.. I want to minimize when employees have questions, they obviously fire at them at me. So many questions. I can’t answer them because  I'm not dealing with the payroll itself, but because I understand payroll, I've done it before, I obviously can spend some time and just be like explaining, okay, this is why your salary has been calculated at this way pays, because I understand… but, for example, I've got two finance assistants that work underneath me. Ideally, I would want to push those questions on to them rather than dealing with it myself. But because they don't understand - they don’t work with payroll - they just can't handle those questions. So I have to do it any way. Is there a function or a possibility where instead of asking me they go directly to Pento?
Eve:
Hi, good question? Yeah. So… your employees wouldn't go directly to Pento. Howeverit is designed to make payroll simple again. So we do eradicate most issues by simply putting in  tax codes and pensions updates through in real time. So that eliminates 99 percent of the issues. We will make payroll simple again, which means that we see a lot of the time. I've dealt with, you know, finance directors, cfos, you know, co-founders where they've been running payroll, and they want to push it down. You will be able to, 100 percent. You know, if you deploy something, you'd be able to get the admin rights to, you know, to the people who have to answer questions. They would be directly responsible. But we help them - So if admins have a question about payroll, what they can do is contact our experts within the tool. And right now our response rate is I think literally about 25 minutes. So they would have real time support within the tool.
Tuf:
Okay.
Eve:
And if anything is worrying you or anything like that from a payroll perspective where you may not have the knowledge because, you know, payrolls can get complicated. Sometimes we have, you know, a hell of a lot of support here which would include things like, you know, your advisory team, which is exactly the same cost. But what we see is that when it comes to the deploying a tool like Pento, it frees people like you up.
Tuf:
Whereby…
Eve:
They can push the path down to maybe less strategic employees so you can focus on more important stuff other than, you know, other than stupid payroll related questions that, you know, it's not, it's marginal in your day-to-day stuff, when you would your worrying on probably on things like audit.
Tuf:
You…
Eve:
Know a lot about, of stuff that you doing fine. So, yeah, there's a lot that you can do with Pento. Gives you that flexibility. Okay? Does that help?
Tuf:
Yep. Yep.
Eve:
Help reassure that kind of point?
Tuf:
Yes, sir.
Eve:
Okay. Amazing. Cool. So let me show you Pento. So in the employee section, you wouldn't be in this space too much, but that's probably the best way to describe Pento in the most simple way. We have the the employee section and the payroll section and the payroll section, as you have an integration with Hibob, you wouldn't be in this section too much. And that's kind of what you want - your  One source of truth for employees right now is your HR, and it should always remain that  but lets just go through it anyway. So this is where all the information will be hosted for each individual employee. Any name changes or updates, that bank, detailed email addresses or anything like that we will update it automatically on the information on our integrations responses within the hour. And what that means is that, you know, always dealing with one source of truth of data on that relationship between you and HR becomes better  And less fragmented because you're not having to, you know, worry whether they've captured the right information, will you know, have excellent capturing what they've done and then sending it through our tool so that's convenient.
Tuf:
If you say, would you say if I'm having to come look for information, for example, bank details. But would you say… would it be easier to come here to look at it?
Eve:
Yeah, yeah. You can come here because the integration would let  you to know that this is one source of truth in pulling through from your HR system. 
Tuf:
Hi, is more, this is more… information to do with payroll. Whereas obviously the HR has so many other HR things to just looking at, and this straightaway just gives me a full view.
Eve:
Yeah. And what’s also super crucial for you and I think this is why I press on you in terms of reporting.

Tuf:
If…
Eve:
Sorry, I've been talking about today. In Pento, there's a lot of controllables and variables you can control. You have the flexibility to set them out as what you want, say for example, in the departments what you can do is you can add department specific to your organization or sites. So as you can imagine as a, you know, there’s a heck of a lot of sites in Starling bank for example, and then you can go one level deeper with custom org field where you can build out custom payroll organizational structure. Where it becomes super crucial for you is as mentioned you can pull that throught to Xero and Hibob. So any reporting that's posting that information is being pulled through. For example, your employee ID here is being pulled through from Hibob. THat’s important. We touched a little on this: on payments. You can pop in any salary change information any time and Pento will pro-rate that depending on the time of the month you’re putting it in. 
Eve:
Let's say on the twelfth of the month or the seventeenth of the month, on the twentieth of the month. Originally, what you're dealing with is that you had cut-offs because of the outsources forced cut-offs. But with Pento and I will show you today is  to completely eradicate cut-offs and it means that employee would be able to be paid for what they work from the twentieth to the end of the month. Neither you nor they will have to worry about not getting paid for 6 weeks. So from an employee engagement perspective, it's super crucial. The reason we enable that for a lot of our customers is number one, it gives you the flexibility. So you will not be dictated by, you know, outsourcing cut-offs, BACS cut-offs and we also enable you to run faster payments. That means it could be as late as 11.59 the night before your pay day. So, you know, it could be the 29th. I mean, I wouldn't necessarily recommend that, but you have the flexibility to do that. What you would do is in Pento, you would fund your account. And so you would transfer funds from your bank before using this page. And then no matter what, you know, whateverthe day, or whether it's 260 K or, you know, 300 K, we would pay your stuff. 
Tuf:
So, you're saying we top up Pento?
Eve:
Yeah. So what you would do is not topping up. You would fund the account. 
Tuf:
The difference between topping up and funding?
Eve:
Yeah. So where do you see topping up?
Tuf:
You said you top it up?
Eve:
Yeah, they’re both the same thing. But essentially the reason why I would say topping up is because next time the payroll section that's starting to monthly, we would kick review. The reason why I say topping up is because on your, onboarding, what we would do is work with you to understand what kind of pay type, it is. So if you pay everything on, you know, whether you get paid or you split the HMRC payments and the PAYE payments. Well, then we can also register that as what you need. Some companies do that for cash, or whateverreason some companies don't they will pay everything on the 30th. Yes. Sometimes the following monthly. So what you would do in that instance is top up your account for PAYE and national insurance, and then the PAYE and national insurance while you and I should show it to them, then you would top up for paying the staff, if that makes sense. But.
Tuf:
It's…
Eve:
Super intuitive, it's easy and you would do that in the tool.
Tuf:
So we basically make a payment to Pento?
Eve:
You would track the funds from your normal bank accounts, select Pento within the account. So in the payments, what you would see funds, this is a really bad example. I can't show you those funds.
Tuf:
What if we underpaid?
Eve:
I believe we will send you a notification out before you submit. So if we registered that there’s not enough funds in your account for the preview payroll, then we would send you a notification saying that that's not enough funds in your account.
Tuf:
Okay.
Eve:
So, yeah, we've got you from that perspective.
Tuf:
So you pay HMRC as well?
Eve:
Exactly. So on here. So super crucial with this, so obviously from a compliance perspective, it's really important to make sure that you're compliant from HMRC. And so what we do is on your onboarding again log into your government gateway. So what that means is that any tax code changes or student loan updates that are happening on the payroll in real time will be pulled through into Pento. So that's also really important again to alleviate and eliminate a lot of those questions that you probably have. Because what we see a lot of the time with outsourcers is that a lot of this is happening manually on the back end and then they’re not identifying, you know, quick enough pay increases or, you know, additional deductions to payslips and not having HMRC, you know, directly connected. And so what they’re doing is that they have running pay on incorrect taxes. And so this is when tax gets top of mind for those individuals or they get emergency taxed. So how it helps is that you're putting through real life tax rate for that individual? So if they get like a pay increase or a pay decrease we would know it happened.
Eve:
But HMRC would do their thing that we would put into Pento in real time. And on the left hand side here, you can see any updates. So if everlike, you know, the junior people underneath you wanted to preempt any of those questions, they can very easily. Because we will tell you when there’s been a big update.

Tuf:
Okay.
Eve:
Yeah, so that’s also super clear. This page is the payroll section. This is where 80 percent of time is saed from an outsourcing perspective. On the right hand side, we can show you real time updates on the payroll. And this is probably the area that gives you the most ability to push a task down. So as you can see on the right hand side, we'll show you a payslip for all employees and all individuals. But on the right hand side show you any of the pro rata increases or decreases and this is in line with your 250 per month. Will also show you again real time analytics. So what you basically saying, what we're trying to do for our customers, is shift them away from this practice of checking and reconciling and doing these check on out sources. Let's get rid of the reconciliations. I should spend the time on checking. I'm doing a quick overview, understand what's going on behind the high level overview of the payroll and then submit that.

Eve:
It should Be as easy as that. But on the right hand side we show you any variances. That’s  where you're gonna want to spend most of your time looking rather than through report after report, figuring out the variance. But yeah, hopefully you can see, hopefully you can kind of see yourself using it. how are you feeling?
Tuf:
Yeah, yeah, I would that's how I guess what I see what I would do. if Pento now takes up the information from high level or the changes generates this information for me. I look at this, see this change of variances and I just go through those green ones basically. And then I guess once I'm happy, do I then submit it here?
Eve:
Yeah. So what you would do is exactly that. So what you're also able to do in settings as you grow is you’re able to create, you know, one offs. If there's anything like that, you need adding the payroll. And again, you'd be very easily able to do that. I'm sorry, my internet. Once you're happy here and you've those checks and naturally, you know that's probably gonna take you 20 minutes, not even gonna lie what you would do is you pick reviews and it's at this point you’re obviously able to manage your account? You're able to do this. So you're able to submit for approval if you wanted to do that. If you need that in your organization. If you don't then don’t set it up. That's up to you. But what you're able to do is submit. And then on your on pay day, what we would do is we pay all automatically and then we would also pay your PAYE and national insurance and at that point, you'd also submit your, yes, to HMRC. And that's all done automatically. The faster a company grows The more likelihood you failed because it should not. So yeah, that's done automatically.
Tuf:
Okay. I've got two questions. So one other thing that I'll get during the payroll change is that not everything is on hibob. For example, one is over time. only the tech team, have this over time, extra payments basically. And they have you on a Google sheet and then for commission and bonus referral bonus is sent to me via email from the HR person. So I initially said I want this on hiBob. We just left it at email. And then I'll just look at the emails. Is there a section on here where HR can come in and just dot it down.
Eve:
HR can have access. So, yeah, you'd be able to have as many admins as you want. What you would do is actually the way that you described having over time is probably the best way to do it because it is so payroll related. And so typically finance is gonna wanna look at those calculations more. We see a lot of times organizations not putting over time and bonuses. So actually, best practice, I would say that you're on the money there. In terms of how you would approach that in Pento, it'll be very easy and will be done in your onboarding. You wouldn't be left to configure this account yourself. But what you would do is you would set up some salaries and you would create salary types based on over time. And it could be like, you know. What you do is you add it. And then within the payroll section, your HR person, what they would do is what they would do is pull out in bulk. So we have a bulk application within Pento. And this is why employee ID is super important. You knowsame employee ID as HRIS. Done, say type in FrontSpin that they need for the idea is once I have a friend and then Pento, work out for you can do that info. So if you've got one sheet and capturing that information, just use this template. And then you can push out to CSV so you’re able to push out a CSV here from your file.
Tuf:
Yeah.
Eve:
The same works with pay items as well. So again in settings, what you can do is create your own pay items. So let’s say create one off sales bonus. And what you can do is set up the way you want. It stays whether it's pensionable or not. And again, that setup we will work with you to ensure that is accurate.
Tuf:
Okay. So.
Eve:
You would see we'll do one offs here and all your recurring. And that would be very easy as doing the exact same thing. Uploading, you know, data from a file but populating the employee ID, selecting what it is. So let’s say bonus and then that’s it really. And all you would need is an employee ID and you can get that in the customs
Tuf:
If someone does put that in, for example, ideally I would want HR to do that
Eve:
That makes sense.
Tuf:
Would it tell me HR did this change


Eve:
That's  very interesting. in the employee section, Yes. But there is no audit trail within the payroll section just because the audit is the variances.
Tuf:
For example, a 16 percent increase, if that was a 500 pound bonus, for example, it would show it as a separate line. I'll go back and check who put that bonus in because it needs to be HR.
Eve:
Yeah. Exactly. So what you would do is completely in terms of how you want to operate as a business. will give you that flexibility to do that. But what you can see here is out of hours plus 65 and obviously, it's gone up by nine percent. So obviously you’re going to want to go in and check that. Another example is let's see I put bonus on. performance bonus three grand. Again, you would see the performance bonus. And so basically, it's increased by 29 percents. You're gonna want to go in and check that. Within the employee section there is an audit log. So any change that's been made in the employee section, we will tell you. That would come up as either hibob because that’s done by the integration or by the individual who has made that change.
Tuf:
So if you go into the employee, it would tell me Iby just added this 3,000 pound bonus?
Eve:
That's a really good question. I don't know whether it would be, I think it's only employee related. Let me come back to you on that… and let me find out what the best practices are with some of our customers.
Tuf:
Because the way we do it via email is for example, we have two recruiters in the company. If they now recruit four people in that month, they send me an email on that. For each person, I get 500 pound bonus that's 2000 pound. If they were to just send it to me without Iby in there, I would just reject it. They need to cc Ivy in and the Ivy approves and then Iby forwards over to me so that's an approval process from my end to know that, okay, HR, has approved it.
Eve:
I'll see what best practices are for that but in that case, I think what would make most sense would be: in your onboarding, you would be given this template and they Ivy or whoeverelse is operating this would populate that template and then send it to you still on an email. And then you would have a look. If you don't want people to go in and you want an individual having control over this, then, yeah, you would have the flexibility to set up in a way that you want. But leave that with me. Let me see what best practices for that. So that as you can imagine, you know, a lot of HR team, sometimes, you know, the HR team deals with this stuff and payroll. But there are companies that I have worked with where HR is very HR and payroll is very payroll. but hopefully hence why I’ve given you some ideas on how you could internally operate a little bit better, a little bit more efficiently because yeah, at the end of the day that's what we're all about.
Tuf:
Yeah. Okay. Is there a way, is there a way? I guess, yeah, it's the same thing.  because what I would want to do because when I'm going for the changes  in HiBob, I missed a step. So on Wednesday, I just jump on a call, with Ivy. And I've obviously populated the spreadsheet with all these changes. Before I send over to the payroll department. I share my screen and just confirm all those changes with her. I'm just thinking if it's now on Pento… when I'm looking at that page, this page here, I guess I'll just go through that with her.
Eve:
Exactly. Or you could givet, you could do it async and give her admin access and she could go in and do it herself or you could, yeah, just show her pento.

Eve:
We have a lot, we have a lot of people partners and HR admins, and, you know, business partners running payroll and using Pento for their payroll application.
Tuf:
Okay.
Eve:
Talk me through how you’re feeling. I feel like there’s a lot that's a lot of synergies with what you're doing, and how Pento can help. I don't know whether you feel the same.
Tuf:
Yeah, it would definitely help. It definitely helps you save some time, I think. And I think it's more reliable.
Eve:
Yeah, 100 per cent human working out.
Tuf:
Yeah, which is more reassuring.
Eve:
Talk me through potential next steps. Do you think anyone else needs to get in front of Pento? What do you think in terms of, you know, because I really do feel that we could help you find the lot and we can connect all of your systems together.
Tuf:
Yeah. I think… I obviously want to know the prices and stuff.
Eve:
I prepared that, I completely agree. Okay, we can go through that now. So essentially… well, you don't just get a platform with Pento what you do is you got a wealth of support as well. So when you like I showed you before that widget and support. you would go in, response rates are under 30 minutes that, you know, UK certified payroll professionals and you also have the ability to access our advisory team. But as we know, as you can imagine, a lot of our customers are high growth scaling and seeing, you know, situations that they've never seen before. And so that's when they would lean on. Our advisory team has been running combined payroll for like 20 30 years and seeing things that, you know, me and you would never want to see. in relation to that. What the pricing would be. Let’s go through a bit of an overview. what that included is all of your integration. So we would start customizing and configure all of your integration. So that be your pension, your accounting, HMRC gateway credential, and your HR system. It would also include the platform which, you know, we haven't even touched on half the stuff. Things like the gross, net reporting, the parents reporting, it gets pushed out into excel format, or CSV format. Thing like real time and automated integrations and tax duty. So things like your P60 and P11D will also all be automated for you as well.
Eve:
And then again, I've touched on support. What that would look like is the unit cost is eight pounds per month per pay slip. With an implementation of 2000 pounds. And so, I think that what's key here is that everything's inclusive with Pento. it's very transparent pricing and we would never bill you for p60s or p11ds, you know adding extra support, adding extra columns into reports. It would always be as transparent as what I'm showing you today. In terms of the onboarding the reason that there’s that implementation fee is that what Pento would do and what we're trying to do is disruption and smooth process of not only moving all of our customers away from our competitors and making that really streamlined and easy for them. But also improving that experience with payroll. There's an element of migration that has to happen which pento would do the Payfit to payfit reconciliation for you. That’s things that you wouldn't need to worry about because we're the experts and that's the best way of doing it. We've had situations in the past where customers have come to us and they've been running payroll on inaccurate numbers from our sources because they’re working it out. And so what we would do in those in the pilot month and then the live month, what we would do is we would flush out, ensure that everything is going into pento accurately.




Tuf:
Yes. Yep. So, yeah. So there's the onboarding fee of 2000?
Eve:
Exactly.
Tuf:
And then if we, for example, have 100 employees?
Eve:
What are you now?
Tuf:
It was about 95 nine six.
Eve:
Okay.
Tuf:
If it was 100, it would be 800 a month, which would be 9,600 annually.
Eve:
Yeah, exactly.
Tuf:
Okay.
Eve:
How are you feeling about that price? How does that compare to what you're paying now?
Tuf:
So we're paying 450 right now. So will have to discuss that with my CFO… before making a decision… because we’re also gonna grow rapidly and obviously, therefore… if it's per employee. So that's a conversation I will have to have with them. But in general, I'm very happy and I think it will be exciting to… sign up and try give Pento ago.
Eve:
That's amazing. In terms of timelines and stuff like that, talk me through. My CEO challenged me to ask this question. What would stop you from signing up right now? What would be the stopper right now?
Tuf:
If I was, if I was able to make a decision right now, I would, there would be nothing that stops me. It's just, I need to discuss with my CFO right now.
Eve:
Okay.
Tuf:
Let me just go back, to my CFO. Are you able to send me this pack?
Eve:
Tuf:
If you could share that pack with me and then I'll have a chat with him probably tomorrow, then once I have a chat with him, then I would give you an update on how we want to progress.
Eve:
Let me know if there’s any back last on pricing too. Like we wouldn't just want it to be done with us, right? In terms of how quickly you want to move.
Tuf:
It would be as soon as possible.
Eve:
Great. Like if we can get everything done by, you know, this time next week or by at least by the last day in September, we can start with my migration process in october and have you live by November.
Tuf:
Okay. It's just, I think I'll have to double check with payroll options and notice and all of that stuff.
Eve:
Yeah.
Tuf:
So, I need to just do those due diligence before I kinda get back to you.
Eve:
We can always push the effective date out. As you can imagine, you know, I have some clients ,adp for example, and they have a notice period of six months, but they really want to go with Pento. And so what we would do is just push the effective day out. So your timeline would be let's say, I don't know November and December rather than October and November.
Tuf:
Yeah.
Eve:
We have that flexibility. Cool. What I'll do then is I'll follow up with this afterwards. I'll also send you the call.
Eve:
I think that would be useful. And yeah. Well, in terms of next steps, it would be you would speak to your CFO tomorrow?
Tuf:
Yes, tomorrow.
Eve:
Would it make sense to maybe put some time like a 15 minute catch up in for friday morning?
Tuf:
Let's do that Friday morning, we got booked.
Eve:
Is 15 minutes enough or do you think there’s anything else that you feel I should go through?
Tuf:
Eve:
What about 11?
Tuf:
See… yeah, 11 works for me.
Eve:
Amazing. Okay. And I'll update with all of your integration and then, yeah, and then send out. Are you on I message?
Tuf:
I'm not, no.
Eve:
All I, I'll just ping you on LinkedIn or something just for like quick immediate?
Tuf:
Yeah, especially on LinkedIn. Yeah.
Eve:
Yeah, I can do that. I'm…
Tuf:
Just trying to find, I'm just trying to find who I spoke to.
Eve:
Yeah, please.
Tuf:
Lauren
Eve:
Yeah. She is still here. She is chief of staff now.

Tuf:
Yeah.
Eve:
Yeah. Okay. Awesome.
Tuf:
Lauren.
Eve:
Yeah, exactly. She is chief of staff now, where did you, where did you work before?
Tuf:
So, before Genflow, I worked at a company called Ceneva, okay, which is a kid's fashion industry and I was the in-house accountant for it. Unfortunately when covid hit, we went into administration and obviously everyone got made redundant, and that's what happened. And then after that, once I started looking for jobs again. I happened to come across Pento, I think Pento reached out to me on LinkedIn. And yeah, just going to compensation. I really liked the idea of Pento. I think I got offered the job.
Eve:
With what was the actual job?
Tuf:
It was, I think it was more what was… it was just dealing with payroll questions and stuff like that. So they wanted me to.
Eve:
Okay. Yeah.
Tuf:
Customer success representative.
Eve:
Yeah, amazing. Okay. Last question.
Tuf:
Well, the thing is as much as I liked it, I wasn't sure to get into payroll because I've done payroll. My  previous job was a management accountant, and prior to that was in the practice where I did payroll. So, because I was made redundant and then my son was born at that year, I was almost like I'm gonna take a break from working, so I took a three to five months break, right? And then once I did that, I was okay, let me just look into. And when Pento reached out, I was more intrigued. So I had a chat and then once I got offered the job, I was quite transparent and I was that I'm not 100 percent sure if I do want to get into payroll and do payroll full-time I just don't…
Eve:
Yeah.
Tuf:
So, let me explore and I'll get back to you. And then when I got in touch with Genflow. 
Eve:
Yeah. Like what Genflow is doing is really exciting. Like I'm not even surprised you have grown as much as you have. Because there’s just such a market for it and I've never seen it before. Like as you can imagine, I speak to customers all day every day, but I don’t think I’ve seen anyone do anything like Genflow.
Tuf:
Yeah, it's incredible because we don't. we're actually in the leaders in the industry. No one's actually competing with us.
Eve:
Yeah. Who is your CEO
Tuf:
Sean.
Eve:
A woman?
Tuf:
No, he's a boy.
Eve:
If you've got any other like people that you think may be interested in, you know, you're looking at Pento and stuff like that, then please pass them on my way.
Eve:
You're probably quite connected. Thanks for your time.
Tuf:
Will speak to you on Friday
Eve:
Amazing.
Tuf:
Okay.
Eve:
have a great day.
